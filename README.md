## How
Simpy run in command line with the desired options. For regular backups, set up a cron script or a systemd timer.

### Command line options
```
-t [token]
```
the API token for `webmention.io`.

```
-d [domain]
```
only ask for webmentions received for specific domain (i.e. `example.org`); all the domains associated with the account will be processed otherwise.

```
-f [filename]
```
the name of the file to save webmentions to (and read the already backed-up webmentions from). Defaults to `webmentions.json` in current directory.

```
-jf2
```
use the `/api/mentions.jf2` endpoint instead of `/api/mentions`. The produced JSON will naturally be JF2 in this case.

```
-tlo=false
```
don't create the top-level object in the saved file (i.e. save as an array of webmentions).

```
-p
```
pretty-print (`jq`-style) the saved file.

```
-cd [directory]
```
look in the `directory` for the directory structure that represents the website's structure and try to save webmentions to the individual files (one for each page) in this directory structure; useful for saving webmentions into the source tree of an SSG project.

```
-l [list]
```
list of comma-separated top-level directories to ignore when using `-cd`; with `-cd ./website -l en,fr` both webmentions for `my.site/en/page` and `my.site/fr/page/` will be saved to `./website/page/webmentions.json` instead of separate directories.

```
-ts
```
when using `-cd`, store a timestamp in the root directory and avoid re-fetching webmentions before that timestamp.
