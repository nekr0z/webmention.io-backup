## How
Simpy run in command line with the desired options. For regular backups, set up a cron script or a systemd timer.

### Command line options
```
-t [token]
```
the API token for `webmention.io`.

```
-d [domain]
```
only ask for webmentions received for specific domain (i.e. `example.org`); all the domains associated with the account will be processed otherwise.

```
-f [filename]
```
the name of the file to save webmentions to (and read the already backed-up webmentions from). Defaults to `webmentions.json` in current directory.

```
-jf2
```
use the `api/mentions.jf2` endpoint instead of `api/mentions`. The produced JSON will naturally be JF2 in this case.
