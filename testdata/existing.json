That is described here: <a href=\"https://help.micro.blog/2017/webmention/\"><span>https://</span>help.micro.blog/2017/webmention/</a> <br /><br />What you might be seeing is that some micro.blog users don't display comments on their posts, so even though they will have received your reply, you won't see it listed as a comment. It will still show up in their timeline though. <br /><br />Recently, Micro.blog also added support for people to include their replies on their own blogs rather than only inside the micro.blog timeline. This is described here: <a href=\"https://help.micro.blog/2020/hosted-replies/\"><span>https://</span>help.micro.blog/2020/hosted-replies/</a> Not everyone has enabled that feature, and not everyone wants that either. <br /><br />I hope this helps clear some things up. <a href=\"https://manton.org/\">@manton</a> is definitely 100% in support of the indieweb goals, and has done an amazing job building Micro.blog. The latest features around receiving external webmentions and hosting replies on peoples' own blogs have made it a really excellent first-class IndieWeb option.","name":null,"published":"2020-04-27T17:08:37-07:00","published_ts":1588032517,"url":"https://aaronparecki.com/2020/04/27/17/microblog"},"id":787877,"private":false,"source":"https://aaronparecki.com/2020/04/27/17/microblog","target":"https://evgenykuznetsov.org/en/posts/2020/microblog-is-bad/","verified":true,"verified_date":"2020-04-28T14:27:37+00:00"},{"activity":{"sentence":"Ryan Barrett commented 'Interesting perspective.

Thank you for writing this up! I do have to disagree a bit though.\n<p>We definitely like and evangelize micro.blog in the indieweb community, but you’re right that it’s not perfect. We’ve documented the incomplete webmention support (<a href=\"https://indieweb.org/web_hosting#Custom_domain_silos\">https://indieweb.org/web_hosting#Custom_domain_silos</a>) and they’ve agreed and said they plan to improve and fix it (<a href=\"https://www.manton.org/2018/10/09/webmention-improvements-on.html\">https://www.manton.org/2018/10/09/webmention-improvements-on.html</a>, <a href=\"https://www.manton.org/2018/10/09/webmention-improvements-on.html\">https://github.com/microdotblog/issues/issues/75#issuecomment-459856232</a>). Manton talks with us regularly, he plans to get standards like webmention fully implemented, and he’s been honest about where the holes are and his plans to fill them in.</p>\n<p>Many of us have met and talked with him in person, and we believe that he’s sincere and authentic about wanting micro.blog to be a fully compatible, good indieweb citizen. We also <em>desperately</em> need fully hosted indieweb options like micro.blog as accessible hosting options for less technical people, and we haven’t have <em>any</em> others since hosted Known disappeared. We should definitely keep working with him and micro.blog as long as they’re willing!</p>\n<p>Lastly…</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Call me paranoid, but when things don’t make sense, I start to suspect malice.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>I get where you’re coming from, but I’m not convinced as a general rule.
